# In Java, the switch statement follows certain rules and conventions.
Here are the rules for using the switch statement in Java:

  -1. The expression used in the switch statement must be of type byte, short, int, char, or an enumerated type (enum).
  -2. Each case within the switch statement should be a unique constant value. Duplicate case values are not allowed.
  -3. The case labels must be constant expressions, which means they should be compile-time constants and not variables or expressions.
  -4. The default case is optional and is executed if none of the case values match the expression.
  -5. The switch statement can have zero or more case statements and an optional default statement.
  -6. Once a matching case is found, the corresponding code block is executed,
  and all subsequent case blocks are also executed unless a break statement is encountered.
  This is called "fall-through" behavior.
  -7. The break statement is used to terminate the execution of the switch statement and exit the switch block.
  -8. If a break statement is omitted, the execution will "fall through" to the next case and
  continue executing the code until a break statement is encountered or the end of the switch statement is reached.
  -9. It is good practice to include a break statement at the end of each case block to prevent unintentional fall-through behavior.
  -10. The switch statement can be nested inside other switch statements or control structures like loops or if-else statements.
  These are the general rules that apply to using the switch statement in Java.
  It's important to follow these rules to ensure correct and predictable behavior of your code.
